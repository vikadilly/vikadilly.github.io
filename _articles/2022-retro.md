Readers of my blog know I've been switching up the blogs and their hosting for... a millenia now. 

I am happy to say this is the last time I do this. Mostly because I really like Markdown and this lets me write in it. 

What a wild year it's been! 

Moved back to London, started going into the office twice a week, broke up, didn't come to terms with the break up until months later, lost weight, regained it, found a calling, got COVID twice, found out my calling was a false one. It's been a roller coaster of a year but I think overall, I am super happy about how things went. 

# This year has been a year of finding my bearings

I started this year out with one goal: I was going to become a âœ¨ Data Scientist âœ¨ 

With that in mind, I took part in Data Science competitions, won one (shout out to the amazing Omar Osman and Dr. Rachel Aranoff for teaming up with me, see our work here: https://github.com/vikadilly/ORLIAn/wiki) 

We got promised that we'd work together with Roche and the organizers to publish our findings (and we saw some promising stuff), only to find out that this wasn't happening. Whatever. This experience taught me that while machine learning is totally cool, I am very happy sticking on course as a Services Engineer. At least I don't have to deal with totally rubbish datasets. 

I then tried to build my own apps and become a ðŸ¦„ Start Up Unicorn Founder ðŸ¦„. One got pretty big... only to find out that it's actually a lot of work and I don't think I quite figured that running a business *is not* developing software. There is a lot for me to learn, both about development and meeting customer requirements. 

Couple that with life changes, relationship drama and other drama, it was a hectic year and culminated in a solid burn out during September.

## Sounds like a lot... Are you ok? 

Honestly, I needed this. It was a totally grounding experience and put me in perspective of where I am and who I am. I am very early in my career and life, there is a lot for me to learn and I need to trust the process instead of rushing towards the first want that comes into my head. Taking things nice and slow, and making sure I understand things before I make a decision. I feel like I've been able to become a better person through these experiences.

If you are reading this and are in your mid to early 20s, one big take-away from all of this is that there is an INCREDIBLE pressure on us to be absolute dynamite. It's not enough to be just keep your head down and focus on what's in front of you - you gotta be side hustling your way into a unicorn, speak 5 languages, dating 5 people a week, have a 6 pack and have 6 figure Youtube channel. 

My lesson for 2022 is that... it's ok to just put your head down and focus on what is in front of you. You'll find you do a better job anyways. Move at your own pace and enjoy the journey. I look forward to keeping it real going into 2023. 

## What are you working on now? 

Did a lot of Android work during the year as a part of my Grad Rotation. Now I am back to doing Services, there's a lot of new things done to AWS and learning to be done. So, I am doing an AWS Certified Developer certification, while building tons of apps using different technologies to get my hands dirty. I plan on using AWS a lot more in my own side projects anyways. 

I have also been re-learning Math from scratch following [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/math)

I decided to this because TBH, I could really use some work on this but I began to enjoy it at university. I wasn't very good at Maths at school but at University, it was incredibly fun and creative to pursue this. I am a programmer after all - this can only make me a better, right? 

This has been incredibly **fun** - I am totally enjoying just solving textbook chapters in my own pace. I am currently learning Calculus. I plan on updating you lot in future posts. So far, I have done the Introduction to Mathematical Thinking course on Coursera but I found the recommended stuff on the Github not rigourous enough (especially on the side of proofs which as I have found, are beautiful and incredibly creative.) So I basically asked on Reddit for good resources and working through textbooks, spending time figuring out proofs and really enjoying the inner workings behind it all. 

My end goal here is to be able to solve [Arnold's Trivium](https://www.physics.montana.edu/avorontsov/teaching/problemoftheweek/documents/Arnold-Trivium-1991.pdf) because it feels like a total call out (hoping to show that "the standard of mathematical culture" is indeed not falling.)

I've also been painting. I got into the routine of finding at least an hour in the day (usually late at night) to just sit down, put a nice podcast and get some minutes in. Been working on figure drawing and planning on continuing 

## What are your New Year Resolutions? 

To put my head down and focus on what is in front of me. I want to start taking on more responsibility at CapitalOne, start delivering bigger impacts and I have had some good ideas over the Chirstmas break. I've been working hard on training my body, I have some targets. I want to hit them. I have tons of Math questions and excercises to solve too. 

I guess, I'd also like to get more into open source again. I haven't done a lot of open-source work since I got hired and that's a shame - I owe a lot to the scene.

Nothing more, nothing less.
