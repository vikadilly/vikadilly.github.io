This guide is to explain who I am for, and who I am not for. Years of being in this wonderful industry working with lots of people, here's a list of things which can help to figure if I am the right person to collaborate with.

How to work with me:

1) We will get on really well if you are straight to the point, can roll with the punches and enjoys the process of creating something and getting feedback. I am way more interested in building a relationship to build ideas off. 

2) I am not particularly the type of person to fall in love with their ideas, and prefer to fail fast and learn quickly. I care a lot about the process and operations - I will always ask what the feedback is and the way we work matters more to me than the actual idea. 

3) If you can switch off and relax, we will 100% get on well. I prefer to work with the long term in mind and I see this as a marathon, not a sprint. 


How to not work with me:

1) If you need someone to blindly build your idea. Implementation isn't where my mind goes first (it's taken years to stop doing that.) I prefer to take time to understand what we are doing and if we have the right data to be making that kind of call. If you are thinking that it's gonna be us in some WeWork at 4AM grinding over some idea we came up with over dinner, I am not your guy for that :(  

2) If you are a technical zealot, then we probably won't get on. I have preferences I enjoy using but when it comes to this sort of thing, I just prefer whatever gets the job done in the way we need it.
