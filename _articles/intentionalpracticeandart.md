# How to make art "right" ? 

I find when I practice skills essential to my job such as math and programming, generally you either got it right or you got it wrong. You didn't "kinda" get the integral wrong, it's wrong. You didn't "kinda" make the function work, it doesn't work and it's failing its tests. 

I find that when I draw however, I don't really have that in my mind. I've been looking to challenge that notion in my head and bring some "rightness" into my creative process. 

I think there is no "right" way to do art, but there is a "right" way to make your art look exactly like what you had in mind.

Not really how to get there currently... am open to ideas
