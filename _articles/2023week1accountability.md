# Week 1 is up! Public Accountability Post! 

Week 1 for 2023 has been a good start on my NYE resolutions. 

# Work Related Goals 

Kicked off some ideas I had in the NYE and started having conversations. Had a chat with my senior about skill development and I came out of that conversation really encouraged. It's good to know that a bit of practice on skills outside of work really does pay off so gonna keep that rolling.

Still working on my AWS certification though. It's a bit dry and I've covered most of it but it's good to get over and done. 

# Relearn Math from Scratch 

Good progress on the whole. I reckon I'll be done with doing Diffrentiation from Calculus 1 this week if I stay consistent and can take my first exam (the MIT OCW one.)
One of the big differences of studying Math now compared to the stuff I did at A-Levels is I spend a lot of time looking at proofs for some of these fundamental ideas which is really fun to do. 

There are some really creative ideas going on there such as Epsilon-Delta proofs for proving limits and the thing about learning from First Principles is that you can see how these ideas are broken into atomic actions.

I am hoping to get my Derek Zoolander Center for Engineers Who Can't Add Good And Who Wanna Learn To Do Other Stuff Good Too

❌ - No big work undertaken to show my development here. Hoping to get something out next week.

# Art Goals 

I haven't done too well on this - I missed my weekly release schedule because I just didn't have a lot of time. Relearning Math takes a lot of time up and on top of keeping on top of my Tae Kwon Do and AWS certifications, there isn't a lot of time left over. It's a bit annyoing but whatever - I did find time every day to draw cubes for my 250 Boxes challenge. 

I am planning to spend this evening focussed here.

❌ - No drawing to share here for my progress. Need to do better in this regard.

# Other Goals 

Started a Duolingo everyday. It's been good but a real boost in helping me get better at speaking another language has been podcasts. I love listening to sports podcasts and have been doing it at the gym a lot. 

Fitness has gone well this week! Hit the gym 5 times a week, kept within my calorie constraints and did IF every day of the week. Not too bad!
