    <p> People call me Vik. It's easier to pronounce than my actual full name so call me that. </p> 
    <p> I am a professional software engineer and I like to paint too.</p>
    <p> I work at CapitalOne in London üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø </p>

    <h2> Why should you care about this blog?</h2>
    <p> I do pretty in-depth analysis of artwork and paintings. I also can program so I tend to do a lot of analysis involving both these things.  </p>

    <br/>

    <h2> What non-painting things are you currently working on?</h2>
    <p> On Fridays, I do open source work so holler at me if you wanna collab on something cool üëá </p>
    <p> When I am not doing that, I am tinkering away at my side projects or making new artwork. </p>

    <h2> Nice website - how did you build it?</h2>

    <p> I forked the <a id="external-link" href="https://github.com/parksb/handmade-blog"> Handmade Blog </a> template because I loved the minimalistic aesthetic and simple set up, added some QoL stuff like hot reloading and deployment against a custom CNAME. </p>
